# Overview

This GitHub repository is being developed for TDL as a feasbility study to demonstrate markdown content creation, editing and publication of typical Xdocumentation in the GitHub environment.

The following figure shows a high level system representation. Component level descriptions are given in subsequent sections.

# Adding Text

Just type to add plain text.

You can add emphasis as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply *Italics*, using single asterisks or underscores either side of the target text.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply **Bold**, using double asterisks or underscores either side of the target text.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply ~~Strikethrough~~ using two tildes (\~~) either side of the target text.

## Indented Text
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indents ARE possible but not native - use normal HTML tagging for this. (multiple \&nbsp;&nbsp;)

# Sections
Sections are typically created by inserting headings.
Headings are predeced by '#' symbols and take the following form:

\# Is a H1

\## Is a H2

\### Is a H3

# Tables

## Basics

Use outer pipes (|'s) to separate columns.

Use dashes (-'s) to separate rows.

There must be at least three dashes separating each header cell from body content.

## Alignment

Control cell horizontal alignment using colons. In the following table:
Column 1 is left aligned

Column 2 is centered

Column 3 is right aligned

|Column 1 | Column 2 |Column 3|
|:------|:------:|-----:|
|Cell 1 | Cell 2| Cell 3|
|Cell 1 | Cell 2| Cell 3|
|Cell 1 | Cell 2| Cell 3|
|Cell 1 | Cell 2| Cell 3|


# Lists
## Numbered
Just type 1, 2, 3 etc for numbered lists:
1. Keys
2. Phone
3. Wallet

## Bulleted
For bulleted lists, precede each item with a dash:
- Apples
- Pears
- Oranges

# Code
Use triple back ticks at the beginning and end of code blocks
```
\```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i, j;
    char input, alphabet = 'A';

    printf("Enter the uppercase character you want to print in last row: ");
    scanf("%c",&input);

    for(i=1; i <= (input-'A'+1); ++i)
    {
        for(j=1;j<=i;++j)
        {
            printf("%c", alphabet);
        }
        ++alphabet;

        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
\```
```
