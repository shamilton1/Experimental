## Images
**Important**: Images should always be inserted using a relative path.

Repositories requiring images should each have a separate and unique image folder.

Use the following construction to insert images:

```
![](/images/<image1.jpg>)
```
Example:

The following figure shows a high level system representation. Component level descriptions are given in subsequent sections.

![](/images/image1.jpg)
