You can link directly between different MD documentation files, whether you are editing the
documentation on GitHub itself, or locally, using a different markup renderer.

You can use an absolute link:

[a link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)

or a relative link:

[a relative link](filename.md)
