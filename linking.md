You can link directly between different MD documentation files, whether you are editing the
documentation on GitHub itself, or locally, using a different markup renderer.

You can use an absolute link as follows:

`[a link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)`

or a relative link:

`[a relative link](filename.md)`

Using relative links means that the documentation can easily stand on its own (without
pointing to GitHub).
