# Prerequisites
A GitHub account with a verified email address is required to allow you to fork repositories and create pull requests.

# Procedure
1.  Login to GitHub.
2.  Use the **Search** feature at the top of the page to navigate to the upstream respository you've been asked to review/edit.
    **Note**: Try to use the full respository path <orgname/repositoryname>, otherise the search results count may be huge.
3.  Click ![](/images/fork.PNG) to create a copy of the repository. 

    A fork is a copy of the original repository. You can make changes to a fork without without affecting the original repository. Using your fork, you can fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with *Pull Requests*.
 4.   Make required changes to markdown files as required. See [Editing Markdown][] for more details.
  As you make changes, you should commit then to your master branch at regular intervals using the **Commit Changes** button at the bottom of the edit screen.
  Commits are analagous to Saves - except each commit gets an assigned a unique ID to help you track them.
     ** ADD NOTE ABOUT PREVIEW?**
 5.   When you are happy with your edits, commit the changes to your master branch a final time.
