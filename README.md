# Overview

With changing user expectations for documentation, GitHub has been identified as a suitable channel for hosting dynamic, flexible engineering content. sledicurnaeiurcnoaerufnc

GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. 
Although mostly used for code, accompanying engineering documentation can also be written, edited, maintained, controlled, and disseminated within the environment.sajdhfngau

GitHub documentation is typically owned by Marketing/Engineering, who are responsible for the initial upload and ongoing hosting of GitHub repositories. However as Technical Writers, we may be required to contribute towards editing and reorganization of documentation prior to public release, or after release as part of development or maintenance efforts. jknfguieryf

Documentation repositories typically comprise a number of markdown (MD) files which writers may be requird to edit. Markdown is a very simple, lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is primarily designed so that it can be easily converted to HTML. rtyurytu
**Note**: Markdown is not intended as a tool for layout, it is designed to simplify the process of writing for the web, so if you find yourself stretching its feature set to do what you need, you might look at whether or not you're using the right tool here. See Gruber's docs:
