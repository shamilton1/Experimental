# Prerequisites
A GitHub account with a verified email address is required to allow you to fork repositories and create pull requests.

# Procedure
1.  Login to GitHub.
2.  Use the Search feature at the top of the page to navigate to the upstream respository you've been asked to review/edit.
    **Note**: Try to use the full respository path <orgname/repositoryname>, otherise the search results count may be huge.
3.  Click Fork to create a personal copy of the repository.
    A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository.   You can fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests.
